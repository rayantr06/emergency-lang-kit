## 🌍 The Problem

Emergency services worldwide face critical challenges:
- **Language barriers** (immigrants, tourists, multilingual regions).
- **Inconsistent call handling** (human error, stress, fatigue).
- **No structured traceability** (legal issues, quality assurance).
- **Impossible to scale** (custom solutions per region).

**Emergency Lang Kit (ELK)** solves this through a modular, language-agnostic architecture.

## ✨ Key Innovation

Unlike monolithic emergency systems, ELK is built on a **Kernel + Plugins** architecture:

```mermaid

    Kernel[⚙️ ELK KERNEL (Universal)] --> Packs[📦 Language Packs]
    Kernel --> Plugins[🔌 Tool Plugins]
```

### **1. Kernel** (Universal)
Core logic that works for ANY language:
- **ASR Pipeline:** Whisper-based abstraction.
- **Intent Extraction:** LLM-powered, schema-enforced.
- **Decision Engine:** Multi-observer resonance logic.
- **Audit:** Legal-grade traceability.

### **2. Language Packs** (Pluggable)
Pre-configured for supported languages (e.g., `fr-FR`, `ar-DZ`).
- **ASR Models:** Fine-tuned Whisper adapters.
- **Ontology:** Emergency Enums (Fire, Medical).
- **Knowledge:** RAG base for protocols.

### **3. Tool Plugins** (Extensible)
- **Annotation Tool:** Web UI for transcription labeling.
- **Analytics:** Post-call KPI dashboard.

## 🎯 Design Principles

1.  **Language-Agnostic Core:** Add new languages without changing the kernel.
2.  **Schema-First:** Strict Pydantic validation (JSON) > Free text. **No hallucinations**.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** AI assists, humans decide on low-confidence cases.
4.  **Audit-First:** Every decision is traceable to source evidence.

## 📐 Architecture Overview

ELK follows the **Language Layer** paradigm:

## 💡 Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Emergency Call (France)
```json
{
  "incident_type": "fire",
  "urgency": "critical",
  "location": {"type": "residence", "address": "12 rue de la Paix"},
  "decision": "dispatch_fire_and_ambulance",
  "confidence": 0.94
}
```
